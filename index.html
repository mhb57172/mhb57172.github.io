	<H2> <i> Baking </i> </H2>
	<p style="font-family:verdana;">My name is Meredith Berry and I started a baking business my sophomore year of high school. My granmother taught me how to bake when I was a little girl. Before she passed away, she gave me her cookbook with all of her favorite recipes. I made cakes, cookies, cupcakes, and more! When I got to high school, I decided to start a business. My mom helped me create a logo for my bakery and advertise my baked treats! I now make cakes for all my friends in Athens, Georgia. Click <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berrygoodbakery">here</a> to go to my Instagram page. When I go home for the holidays, my friends in Fort Worth, Texas ask me to make them cakes too! </p>
        <p>My favorite quote is by John Lennon <q style="font-family:cursive;">Life is what happens when youâ€™re busy making other plans.</q></p>
	<H2> <i> Painting </i> </H2>
	<p style="font-family:verdana;">I have always loved to paint and make art. I want to minor in art because I love drawing in my free time. My dad is an artist and he has sold many paintings of his own. He taught me how to paint when I was a little girl. I went to art classes after school every day when I was in elementary school. I would make gifts for my friends and family. My dad taught my sister and I how to paint and draw because he learned when he was younger, too. I hope I can be an artist one day. </p>

        <h2> <i> Traveling </i> </h2>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;">I also love to travel. I have been lucky enough to visit many places around the world with my friends and family. My favorite place I've ever been in Botswana in Africa. I love safari trips and learning about wild animals. My cousins are from Nice, France and my family would visit them every year for the holidays when I was younger. I want to study abroad next year and travel to somewhere in Europe or Asia. I have never been to Asia or Australia and I would love to visit. </p> </center>
